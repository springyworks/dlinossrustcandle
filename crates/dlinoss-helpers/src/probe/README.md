# Candle Probe (Migrated)

This directory contains the Candle integration probe functionality, migrated from `TEMPTEST/candle_probe` into the `dlinoss-helpers` workspace sub-crate.

## Purpose

The probe validates that essential Candle operations work correctly with the local Candle workspace dependency:
- `cumsum` , `inclusive_scan` and `exclusive_scan` for sequential scan operations  
- `rfft` and `irfft` for FFT-based kernelization (when `fft` feature is enabled)

## Migration Details

**Original location**: `/TEMPTEST/candle_probe/`  
**New location**: `/crates/dlinoss-helpers/src/probe/`  
**Migration date**: August 18, 2025

### Changes Made
- Source code moved from standalone crate to module within `dlinoss-helpers`
- Dependencies integrated into `dlinoss-helpers/Cargo.toml`
- Test functions preserved exactly as implemented
- Feature gates maintained (`fft` feature for FFT operations)

## Usage

### As Module Tests
```bash
# From workspace root
cargo test -p dlinoss-helpers
cargo test -p dlinoss-helpers --features fft
```

### In Code
```rust
use dlinoss_helpers::probe::candle_probe;

// The probe functions are available as regular functions
// though they're primarily intended as tests
```

## Integration

This probe is now integrated into the workspace structure and can be used by the xtask workflow for `verify-candle` operations. The functionality remains identical to the original standalone version.

## Files

- `candle_probe.rs`: Core probe test functions (migrated from `lib.rs`)
- `mod.rs`: Module declaration

## Future

This integration allows the probe to be maintained as part of the main workspace rather than as a separate temporary test crate. The probe functionality may be expanded or integrated more deeply into the helper utilities as the project evolves.
