# D-LinOSS Showcase Media

This directory contains example render capture videos of the 3D playground.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `3dmatrixviewerflythrough.avi` | Fly-through / orbit demonstration of voxel sphere field animation. |
| `dlinossrustcandleringandmovingballs.avi` | Ring buffer driven animation showing dynamic sphere scaling and motion. |

## Purpose
These assets are for README embedding, demos, and social previews.

## Licensing & Storage
Unless otherwise noted, these media files are provided under the repository's dual license (MIT + Apache-2.0) as illustrative assets. If you reuse them externally, please attribute `springyworks/dlinossrustcandle`.

Large raw capture videos are tracked with Git LFS (`*.avi`). If you cloned without LFS, install it (`git lfs install`) and re-pull to fetch binaries.

## Regeneration
You can regenerate updated captures by running the playground with capture enabled (toggle in UI) or using a future CLI capture task.
